# Punching and Stabbing

When two opponents come into base-to-base contact movement stops and fighting starts.

## Action Resolution

Fighting involves three possible actions resolved in rock, paper, scissors fashion.

- Punch (rock): Use a fist or weapon to attack.
- Shove (paper): Push or flip your opponent either away from oneself _or_ onto someone/thing else.
- Steal (scissors): Take look or items from the opponent

Players count 1, 2, 3 and then show their choice (on the beat _after_ 3 not _on_ 3).

Both actions are resolved unless cancelled out:
- Punch cancels Steal
- Shove cancels Punch
- Steal cancels Shove

The active model's action is resolved first.

If after resolution both models are still in b2b contact and standing, then choose actions and repeat. This should mean there is never a case of being "in combat" at the start of a model's activation (???).

### Punch

Roll the Punch Dice for your weapon (if the attacker has no weapons they are using fists). Each die that is equal or greater than the opponent's toughness does big damage, otherwise it does weak damage.

### Shove

The opponent is moved 3" away from the shover in _any_ direction, resolve collisions with any other models or terrain as appropriate. WHERE SHOULD THAT INFO GO... a) shoved into another model ? b) shoved into breakable terrain c) shoved into non-breakable terrain

### Steal

The opposing player gives the stealing player 1 loot token...

??? This means loot has to be important in all scenarios else no one will steal and that could create a weird imbalance in the resolution.
