# Chaos in Cowtown

A western skirmish game of carousing cowboys powered by Riot Dice, an open-source rules engine by Mike Hutchinson (https://planetsmashergames.com/riot-dice).

This is a work in progress.

## Introduction

At the end of the cattle drive, after weeks on the range, the cowboys' wallets are full and they are ready to party; the town becomes a riot of carousing. Inevitably fights break out over money, women, gambling, or just because someone is ornery. The sheriff and his deputies mostly stay out of the fist fights, ready to lock up whoever remains standing, but when a gunshot rings out, they will move into arrest perpetrators.

You are the cowboys. Giddy-up.


## What you need to play

- Playing Area: A 2' x 2' space is probably sufficient for 2 players. For more players you may want to scale up a bit.
- Terrain: this game will be more fun with more terrain, in particular
  - buildings your miniatures can enter
  - windows and doors that can be crashed through
  - tables and chairs that can be broken
  - railing and troughs that can be broken
  - barrels and crates to hide behind
  - fences to jump over and corral animals
  - whatever else feels appropriate to an old west town
- Miniatures: this was designed with 28mm miniatures in mind
  - Cowboys: 3 per player
  - Townsfolks: Depending on the scenario a bunch of folks hanging around town, working their stores, etc.
  - Sheriff and Deputies: Depending on the scenario, a sheriff and a couple deputies
  - Animals: Never hurts to have some horses tied up out front, some pigs or chickens wandering about, and a few cows ready to escape the pen and stampede down the street
- Loot and Item Tokens: While you can use flat tokens for loot and items, you could also use miniatures
- Broken Tokens: Something you can attach to parts of terrain to indicate they are broken
  - Cardboard chits with some clear removable tape or sticky tack on the back should work to not damage your terrain/minis.
- Dice: A lot of mostly d6s, and a few other polyhedral dice
- Measuring device
