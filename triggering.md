# Triggering

Townsfolk, The Law, and Animals only start activating when triggered. Triggering is the result of some (or NPC) action taken within a certain range of the affected model.

Triggering is defined as `[Action] (Range)` so `Shooting (6)` means the model is triggered if shooting occurs within 6". Generally a trigger only occurs within line of sight.

Any NPC directly attacked (Shooting or Punching) is automatically triggered after the attack is resolved.

Once triggered and Fear/Aggression is resolved a token for the model is added to the activation discard pile to be used next round.

# Fear/Aggression Dice

When a model is triggered roll both its Fear and Aggression Dice on the table, just like rolling a Cowboy's Movement Dice.

If a model only has one or the other then the model is set to that status.

If a model has both dice then the type with the greatest sum amongst all the dice decides the model's status.

Remove the dice that are _not_ the model's current status.

In general, once set an NPC's Fear/Aggression status will not change.


## Fear

The model always moves _away_ from the triggering model/location/posse???.

## Aggressive

The model moves _toward_ the triggering model/location/posse, unless...

If the model has a ranged weapon and LOS it will shoot per the normal shooting rules.

For fairness the player who controls the targeted model, should _not_ be the one rolling the shooting dice.


## Passive

NPC models that have no other status are considered Passive. They do not activate.
