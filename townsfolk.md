# Townsfolk

Just minding their business (and their businesses). Some will flee in the face of trouble, some will act aggressively against cowboys starting trouble.

Fear Dice: xd6
Aggression Dice: xd6
Grit: 3 ??? (or randomize?)
Weapons: as miniature ???
Items: ???


Triggering:
- Townsfolk only move/act when triggered...
- What triggers them:
  - Line of Sight shooting or violence (violence includes breaking stuff)

When triggered:


Roll xd6 Fear and xd6 Aggression...
- if the total of the fear is greater
  - move the model away from the nearest model that has shot, punched, or smashed.
  - draw an imaginary line that crosses the fear die and the model.
  - move the model in either direction the die number in inches as long as it is away from cowboy(s)
- if the total of the aggression is greater
  - move the model towards from the nearest model that has shot, punched, or smashed.
  - draw an imaginary line that crosses the aggression die and the model.
  - move the model in either direction the die number in inches as long as it is towards the cowboy(s)
- Add a token by the model to indicate fear/aggression. They will continue to act in that manner for subsequent rounds.

Maybe if the aggressive townsfolk has a gun the aggression dice can act as shoot dice....???

Townsfolk do not get dice towers. If they take any damage they are Knocked Over.

After a townsfolk is triggered and acts. Add a token for them to the discarded activation pile. They will act again next round.
