# Activation Order

Activation order is decided by drawing tokens (from a bag or cup or whatever else you have handy).

Each player adds 1 token for each model in their gang. These should be identifiable as to which _player_ they belong to but should otherwise be the same (i.e. not a different token for each model).

When an NPC (townsfolk, deputy, animal) is triggered, add a token for that type to the bag/cup immediately (i.e. all will get a activation on the town they are triggered).

When a player's model or NPC is taken off the board (for any reason), remove an associated token (it that model has already activated remove it from the discard pile, else remove it from the bag/cup).

Each turn lasts until all the tokens from the bag are removed.

Player's take turns pulling from the token bag and either:
a) activating one of their own models
b) activating an NPC
c) passing the token to an opponent so that player can activate their model
