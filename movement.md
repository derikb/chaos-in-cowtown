# Movement

## Cowboys

Carousing cowboys move a bit erratically. Roll their Move Dice onto the table (one at a time or all at once?). One die at a time (in any order) move the cowboy the die's result number in inches _or less_ towards the die. You may choose to not move at all for any or all of the dice (sometimes a cowpoke is just tired of running about).

## Townsfolk

Less Move Dice? (One player rolls, the other play moves them?)
Forced movement (away from violence? towards violence?) (Maybe NPCs have an aggression die)

## Animals

Maybe they have a fear die or something to decide if they move away from action.

Maybe a fear AND aggression die you roll both and the higher one wins? These could _also_ be the move die (use colors to differentiate? (red/yellow?) black/white)

Moving away means after the die lands you either move the distance _towards_ the die or you move the distance _away_ from the die, depending on the location of noise/violence/etc.

We can then manipulate the fear/aggression of individuals by giving them higher or more dice to roll of either color.


## Obstacles

If the location of the die causes the mini to meet up with terrain, the mini will either stop that die's movement. Alternately some terrain can be climbed up or over if the die roll is high enough to get the mini over/up. (EXAMPLE to clarify)

Maybe can a die on the dice tower if you stumble over an obstacle?

## Tokens

If you cross any loot or item tokens during movement you may pick them up.
