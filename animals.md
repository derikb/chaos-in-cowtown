# Animals

Add some extra chaos by including animals on the board. Similar to townsfolk, animals have Fear and Aggression dice that are rolled when they are triggered. Each animal has its own triggering mechanism, which include:

- Approach (x): Any model moves within x" of the animal.
- Shooting (x): Any model shoots a gun within x" of the animal.

Some animals will break terrain they move into.

How do animals handle b2b with humans?
