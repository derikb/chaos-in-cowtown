# General Concepts

## Rolling Dice

- Most dice rolls are made _on_ the table and the end location of the die when rolled is important to the results.
- Both the rolled number _and_ the location of the die are important for most rolls

## Dice Tower

- The dice tower is made up of d6 stacked adjacent to the model's base (anywhere around the base).
- For each point of damage taken add a die to the tower (if the tower does not yet exist then start one somewhere touching the model's base).
- The tower must stay touching the model's base during movement... If you want to _climb_ you must lift the dice tower without any of the dice falling off.
- If you knock down your own model's dice tower the model is Knocked Over.
- If you knock down your opponent's dice tower that model gets a surge of adrenaline (or liquid courage). Their dice tower is removed and they are _not_ Knocked Over.
