# The Law

In most scenarios the law will remain off the board until a cowboy fires a gun.


When are they activated: any shooting (players or townsfolk)
How do they move:
    - They enter from a randomly selected boardedge (or a jail/office if there is one on the table)
    - Roll 3d6 (?) They will always move in a line _towards_ perpetrators.
Arrests: If adjacent to a knocked over cowboy, they will arrest as an action..
    - What happens then???
