# Shooting and Throwing

Some cowboys, townsfolks, or deputies have guns and can shoot them, others have or can pick up objects to throw (bottles, knives, rocks, chairs).

Each weapon or item has a range in inches (the maximum it can go to hit a target) and one or more Range Dice (1d6, 4d4, etc.) and a number of attacks (1 unless otherwise stated).

Roll the Range Dice onto the table. Draw a line between the active model and the dice. Anything within the range of the weapon/item and on that line can be hit. For each attack you may choose a targets from the options, but only 1 per rolled die. (i.e. if the weapon has multiple attacks you can't hit multiple targets on the same line between the active model and a single die).

Compare the result of the die to the targets Grit. If the number is equal to or greater than the target's Grit the target takes the weapon/item's big damage, else it takes the weak damage (which in some cases can be 0).

Weapons have an ammo number which indicates how many times they may be shot or thrown (thrown items tend to have ammo of 1, you can't throw that bottle twice).

Some weapons have special rules, see the [weapon descriptions](./weapons.md) for more.
